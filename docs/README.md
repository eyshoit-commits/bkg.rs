# BKG Platform Documentation

Welcome to the BKG platform. The documentation set is organised as follows:

- [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md) – high-level overview of the monorepo, runtime topology, and data flows.
- [`plugins.md`](./plugins.md) – how plug-ins are structured, built, and integrated with the plug-in bus.
- [`deployment.md`](./deployment.md) – container build, environment variables, and operational guidance.
- [`operations.md`](./operations.md) – runtime procedures, health monitoring, and administrative tasks.
